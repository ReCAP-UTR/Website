  abstract = {The ReCAP project is a recently started project within the DFG priority programm robust argumentation machines (RATIO). It follows the vision of future argumentation machines that support researchers, journalistic writers, as well as human decision makers to obtain a comprehensive overview of current arguments and opinions related to a certain topic, as well as to develop personal, well-founded opinions justified by convincing arguments. Unlike existing search engines, which primarily operate on the textual level, such argumentation machines will reason on the knowledge level formed by arguments and argumentation structures. The focus of ReCAP is on novel contributions to and confluence of methods from information retrieval and knowledge representation and reasoning, in particular case-based reasoning. The aim is to develop methods that are able to capture arguments in a robust and scalable manner, in particular representing, contextualizing, and aggregating arguments and making them available to a user. Together with experts from the political domain real-world scenarios and use cases are worked out. A corpus of semantically annotated argumentations is being created from relevant text sources and will be made available to the argumentation research community.}

It answers the call for a Qualia bootstrapping tool with a ready-to-use system that can be gradually filled by the community with patterns in multiple languages. Qualia structures express the meaning of lexical items. They describe, e.g., of what kind the item is (formal role), what it includes (constitutive role), how it is brought about (agentive role), and what it is used for (telic role). They are also valuable for various Information Retrieval and NLP tasks. Our application requires search patterns for Qualia structures consisting of POS tag sequences as well as the dataset the user wants to search for Qualias. Samples for both are provided alongside this paper. While samples are in German, QualiAssistant can process all languages for which constituency trees can be generated and patterns are available. Our provided patterns follow a high-precision low-recall design aiming to generate automatic annotations for text mining but can be exchanged easily for other purposes. Our evaluation shows that QualiAssistant is a valuable and reliable tool for finding Qualia structures in unstructured texts.},

One line of research explores ways of reasoning with natural language arguments coming from information sources on the web as a foundation for the deliberation and synthesis of arguments in specific domains. This paper builds upon arguments represented as argument graphs in the standardized Argument Interchange Format. While previous work was focused on the development of semantic similarity measures used for the case-based retrieval of argument graphs, this paper addresses the problem of clustering argument graphs to explore structures that facilitate argumentation interpretation. We propose a k-medoid and an agglomerative clustering approach based on semantic similarity measures. We compare the clustering results based on a graph-based semantic measure that takes the structure of the argument into account with a semantic word2vec measure on the pure textual argument representation. Experiments based on the Microtext corpus show that the graph-based similarity is best on internal evaluation measures, while the pure textual measure performs very well for identifying topic-specific clusters.},

An argument consists of a claim, such as “We should abandon fossil fuels”, which is supported or attacked by at least one premise, for example “Burning fossil fuels is one cause for global warming”. From an information retrieval perspective, an interesting task within this setting is finding the best supporting and attacking premises for a given query claim from a large corpus of arguments. Since the same logical premise can be formulated differently, the system needs to avoid retrieving duplicate results and thus needs to use some form of clustering. In this paper we propose a principled probabilistic ranking framework for premises based on the idea of tf-idf that, given a query claim, first identifies highly similar claims in the corpus, and then clusters and ranks their premises, taking clusters of claims as well as the stances of query and premises into account. We compare our approach to a baseline system that uses BM25F which we outperform even with a primitive implementation of our framework utilising BERT.},

We present a quality-aware ranking framework for arguments already extracted from texts and represented as argument graphs, considering multiple established quality measures.

  abstract = {Automated argument retrieval for queries is desirable, e.g., as it helps in decision making or convincing others of certain actions. An argument consists of a claim supported or attacked by at least one premise. The claim describes a controversial viewpoint that should not be accepted without evidence given by premises. Premises are composed of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are their smallest contextual components. Oftentimes argument search engines find similar claims to a query first before returning their premises. Due to heterogeneous data sources, premises often appear repeatedly in different syntactic forms. From an information retrieval perspective, it is essential to rank premises relevant for a query claim highly in a duplicate-free manner. The main challenge in clustering them is to avoid redundancies as premises frequently address various aspects, i.e., consist of multiple EDUs. So, two tasks can be defined: segmentation of premises in EDUs and clustering of similar EDUs. In this paper we make two contributions: Our first contribution is the introduction of a noisy dataset with 480 premises for 30 queries crawled from debate portals which serves as a gold standard for the segmentation of premises into EDUs and the clustering of EDUs. Our second contribution consists of first baselines for the two mentioned tasks, for which we evaluated various methods. Our results show that an uncurated dataset is a major challenge and that clustering EDUs is only reasonable with premises as context information.},

  abstract = {Computational argumentation and especially argument mining together with retrieval enjoys increasing popularity. In contrast to standard search engines that focus on finding documents relevant to a query, argument retrieval aims at finding the best supporting and attacking premises given a query claim, e.g., from a predefined collection of arguments. Here, a claim is the central part of an argument representing the standpoint of a speaker with the goal to persuade the audience, and a premise serves as evidence to the claim. In addition to the actual retrieval process, existing work has focused on (1) classifying polarities of arguments into supporting or opposing, (2) classifying arguments by their frames (such as economic or environmental), and (3) clustering similar arguments by their meaning to avoid repetitions in the result list. For experiments, either hand-made argument collections or arguments extracted from debate portals were used. In this paper, we extend existing work on argument clustering, making the following contributions: First, we introduce a novel pipeline for clustering arguments. While previous work classified arguments either by polarity, frame, or meaning, our pipeline incorporates these three, allowing a more systematic presentation of arguments. Second, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 365 argument graphs accompanying more than 11,000 high-quality arguments that, contrary to previous datasets, have been generated, displayed, and verified by journalists and were published in newspapers. A thorough evaluation with this dataset provides a first baseline for future work.},

For testing different algorithms such as the retrieval of the best arguments, which are still in their infancy, gold standards must exist. An argument consists of a claim or standpoint that is supported or opposed by at least one premise. The generic term for a claim or premise is Argumentative Discourse Unit (ADU). The relationships between ADUs can be specified by argument schemes and can lead to large graphs. This paper presents a corpus of 100 argument graphs with about 2,500 ADUs in German, which is unique in its size and the utilisation of argument schemes. The corpus is built from natural language texts like party press releases and parliamentary motions on education policies in the German federal states. Each high-quality text is presented by an argument graph and created by the use of a modified version of the annotation tool OVA. The final argument graphs resulted by merging two previously independently annotated graphs based on detailed discussions.},

  abstract = {Finding information online is hard, even more so once you get into the domain of argumentation. There have been developments around the specialized argumentation machines that incorporate structural features of arguments, but all current approaches share one pitfall: They operate on a corpora of limited sizes. Consequently, it may happen that a user searches for a rather general term like cost increases, but the machine is only able to serve arguments concerned with rent increases. We aim to bridge this gap by introducing approaches to generalize/specialize a found argument using a combination of WordNet and Large Language Models. The techniques are evaluated on a new benchmark dataset with diverse queries using our fully featured implementation. Both the dataset and the code are publicly available on GitHub.},

Additionally, current CBR frameworks are not as usable as Machine Learning (ML) frameworks that can be deployed with only a few lines of code. To address these problems and allow users to easily build hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems by combining CBR with techniques such as ML, we present the CBRkit library in this paper. CBRkit is a Python-based framework that provides generic and easily extensible functions to simplify the creation of CBR applications with advanced similarity measures and case representations. The framework is available from GitHub and PyPI under the permissive MIT license. An initial user study indicates that it is easily possible even for non-CBR experts and users who only have limited Python programming skills to develop their own customized CBR application.},

  abstract = {With the Web augmenting every day and computers increasingly getting more powerful, research in the field of computational argumentation becomes more and more important. One of its research branches is argument retrieval, which aims at finding and presenting users the best arguments for their queries. Several systems already exist for this purpose, all having the same goal but reaching it in different ways. In line with existing work, an argument consists of a claim supported or attacked by a premise. Now that argument retrieval has become a separate task in the CLEF lab Touché, displaying the ranking is becoming increasingly important. In this paper we present QuARk, a GUI that allows users to retrieve arguments from a focused debate collection for their queries. Since we strictly distinguished between frontend and backend and kept the communication between them simple, QuARk can be extended to integrate various argument retrieval systems, assuming some modifications are made. In order to demonstrate the GUI, we show the integration of a complex retrieval algorithm that we also presented in the CLEF lab Touché. Our retrieval process consists of two parts. In the first step, it finds the most similar claims to the query. Therefore, the user can select between different standard IR similarity methods. The second step ranks the premises directly related to the claims. Therefore, the user can choose to rank the arguments either by quantitative, qualitative, or a combined measure.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, information on any topic can be researched on the Internet. However, in addition to reputable news sources, there is also a great deal of fake news that is disseminated, e.g., via social media or in established newspapers. Thus, the veracity must be assessed for each piece of information. People, parties, and organizations want to push through their interests and sometimes do not hesitate to spread fake news. For some time now, one popular means has been to quote (supposed) experts in a field. For example, —due to his authority— Albert Einstein is often quoted by believers in God although he was primarily concerned with physics while his quotes on God are taken out of context. In this paper, we define a new task of expert suitability prediction and evaluate methods to assess the credibility of a person with reference to a statement and its context and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches applying transformer-based embeddings. In an R4 cycle in CBR this approach could be used for the ranking. In this pilot study, we restrict our experiments to researchers, which allows us to derive their expertise from their publications. Furthermore, we make a manually labeled dataset consisting of 1,700 (statement,expert) pairs where suitable experts were tediously searched out together with valuable context information (such as convincing text parts of the experts’ contexts towards a statement) publicly available to stimulate further research in this very important, but up to now underrepresented area of fake news detection.},

  abstract = {Research on computational argumentation is currently being intensively investigated. The goal of this community is to find the best pro and con arguments for a user given topic either to form an opinion for oneself, or to persuade others to adopt a certain standpoint. While existing argument mining methods can find appropriate arguments for a topic, a correct classification into pro and con is not yet reliable. The same side stance classification task provides a dataset of argument pairs classified by whether or not both arguments share the same stance and does not need to distinguish between topic-specific pro and con vocabulary but only the argument similarity within a stance needs to be assessed. The results of our contribution to the task are build on a setup based on the BERT architecture. We fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model for three epochs and used the first 512 tokens of each argument to predict if two arguments share the same stance.}

  abstract = {Podcasts have emerged as a significant platform for the exchange of ideas, opinions, and knowledge on a variety of topics. At the same time, the extraction of arguments (called: argument mining) has received great attention. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exist no work that investigates the extraction of arguments from podcasts. One reason can be that podcasts often involve unpredictable and complex argument structures, and extracting valuable insights from them is challenging. In this work, we present the novel approach of extracting two different types of argumentative structures from podcast after transcribing them, i.e., (1) a simple but often used variant describing arguments as consisting of only a claim and a premise, where the claim describes the standpoint and the premise the reason to support or attack that claim and (2) an extended variant where an argument comprises premises, a main claim, counterarguments, and rebuttals. For this purpose, we utilize two specially designed prompts and OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model. For our test data, we chose three podcasts considering current computational constraints and the need for diversity in topics and discussion styles. Our evaluation shows the high feasibility of extracting arguments from podcasts using ChatGPT. We publish the podcasts’ transcripts as well as the extracted arguments.},
